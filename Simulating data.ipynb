    "# Biological background\n",
    "## Cellular biology\n",
    "For a cell to enter mitosis, it first needs to undergo a series of changes called **interphase**. Interphase can be divided in three phases - G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "During the G<sub>1</sub> phase, amount of DNA in the cell remains the same. During the S phase, amount of DNA is increasing, only to be doubled in the G<sub>2</sub> phase.\n",
    "Thus, depending on the amount of DNA, one can classify a single cell as belonging to either of those three phases. \n",
    "\n",
    "## DNA measuring\n",
    "Content of the DNA can be measured indirectly, using intercalating flourescent dyes such as **propidium iodide** (PI) that bond to DNA molecules within the cells. Uniform suspension of cells is then passed through a flourescent cytometer that is capable of detecting single cells (*events*) and measuring the intensity of PI flourescence. Since this is an indirect measurement of DNA through PI signal intensity, repeated sampling of cells in say, G<sub>1</sub> phase, won't give the same values, but will give values that are distributed according to normal distribution. In general, measuring N amount of cells whose DNA content is X will be normally distributed with mean of PI(X) and standard deviation $\\sigma$ where PI(X) is a function that translates DNA content into PI flourescence. Since we will be comparing cell content, we are not interested in the *exact amount* of DNA present in the cells, and thus we will make an assumption that PI(X) ~ X.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mathematical modelling\n",
    "## Modeling DNA distributions\n",
    "There are three aforementioned phases where the amount of DNA is different. We can model each of the phases by different function.\n",
    "G<sub>1</sub> phase can be approximated as $ G_{1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1},\\,\\sigma^{2}_{1})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "G<sub>2</sub> phase can be approximated as $ G_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{2},\\,\\sigma^{2}_{2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problematic phase to model is the S phase, because the content of DNA in the phase is anywhere between the amount of DNA in G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> phase. The selected model for S phase will be an infinite sum of normal distributions according to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\int_{2n}^{4n} \\!w_{x} \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{x},\\,\\sigma^{2}_{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In here, 2n and 4n are the amount of DNA in G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> phase, while w represents a **weight** on the normal distribution, or the fraction of cells that have DNA content of X within the S phase. Making the assumption that all *weights* are equal, and that standard deviation are equal, and that $mu_{x}$ is simply x the above equation transforms into:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\!w_{s}\\int_{2n}^{4n}  \\mathcal{N}(x,\\,\\sigma^{2}_{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$.\n",

    "## Mixture model\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard operating procedure of a flow cytometer is to acquire a number of events (ranging in thousands) regardless of parameters of events. Thus, a suspension of cells that's a *mixture* of the cells from G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub> phases is best approximated as a *mixture* model of DNA distributions of particular phases. We can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$model= w_{G1} \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1},\\,\\sigma^{2}_{1}) + w_{G2} \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{2},\\,\\sigma^{2}_{2}) + (1-w_{G2}-w_{G1})\\ U(mu_{1},mu_{2})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the expression $(1-w_{G2}-w_{G1})$ is equal to $w_{s}$, but since a mixture model requires all weights to be equal, we only need $n-1$ weights to describe a mixture of $n$ components. Standard constraints apply (ie. all weights must be equal or greater than 0, and their sum must be 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Application of cytostatic agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain molecules can inhibit normal progression of cell division by various means. These molecules are called *cytostatics* (meaning they *stop* cells). Treating cells with a cytostatic will lower the amount of cells in S and/or G<sub>2</sub> phase. In our model, the *weights* of S and/or G<sub>2</sub> will lower by amounts $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$, but the *weight* of G<sub>1</sub> will increase by those same amounts. We represent amounts $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ as one factor - *the cytostatic factor of difference* or **${d}$**. If ${d}$ is 100 (or 1, depending on implementation), all cells will be of G<sub>1</sub> phase and the model will only have only one relevant normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also unlikely to happen, even with strong *cytostatics*, as there will be cells in S and/or G<sub>2</sub> phase prior to treating them with the cytostatic. Therefore we can add two additional parameters that *modify* the *strength* of acting cytostatic calling them ${gs}$ as \"G strength\" and ${ss}$ as \"S strength\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing all three factors can be done by a formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "${reduction}_{(G2)}=w_{(G2)} {d} {gs}$\n",
    "\n",
    "${reduction}_{(S)}= w_{(S)} {d} {ss}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_{(G2)} = w_{(G2)}-{reduction}_{(G2)} = w_{(G2)} (1-{d} {gs})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_{(S)} = w_{(S)}-{reduction}_{(S)} = w_{(S)}(1-{d} {ss})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_{(G1)} = w_{(G1)} + {reduction}_{(G2)} +  {reduction}_{(S)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, *cytostatic factor d* represents our *certainty* that an applied agent is cytostatic. Respective strengths represent *power* of an applied cytostatic.\n",

    "# Programing implementation\n",

    "## Simulation of data\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate data, taking into consideration everything written above, we can write a Python code to *simulate* and *draw* the data. Additionally, interactive sliders for *cytostatic factor of difference*, *G strength*, and *S strength* is provided. Run the following code to get the simulated data!"
