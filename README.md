# Cell-cycle-ML

This python notebook is made with the purpose of trying to find a new way to evaluate a compound's (a molecule) effect on cell cycle.

This notebook makes extensive use of IPython widgets to provide interactivity, and for full experience, I recommend downloading (or "cloning") it. 
One requiremend for our code is [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) library. Another may be Jupyter Lab 3.0. or anything that enables IPython widgets.
